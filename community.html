					<h2>How It Started</h2>
					<p>At the beginning of her journey into tech, Kaci felt isolated, even with the rich resources available today that many women before her never had. 
						Believing she couldn’t be the only one experiencing this, she reached out on social media to connect with other women in tech in the Colorado Springs area. To her surprise, the response was immediate and enthusiastic — a community of women who shared her experience quickly came together. This momentum led to the founding of Southern Colorado Women in Technology.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="going">
					<h2>How It's Going</h2>
					<p>Though still a small group, the community continues to grow steadily. 
						Members meet on the first Saturday of each month to collaborate, share ideas, and network with other women in the field who bring a wide range of skills and experience.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="support">
					<h2>How to Support</h2>
					<p>If someone you know might be interested in joining SoCo WIT, Kaci encourages you to spread the word. 
						The group is always eager to welcome new members and continue diversifying its community with strong, talented women.</p>
