					<h3>How It Started</h3>
					<p>At the beginning of my journey into tech, I felt isolated despite the rich resources at my fingertips that previous women didn't have the luxury of having.
					I knew I couldn't be the only one, so I attempted to reach out to other women in tech local to the Colorado Springs area through social media.
					To my surprise, it was an instant hit — I found a community who often felt the same way I did. This led to the founding of Southern Colorado Women in Technology.

					<h3>How It's Going</h3>
					<p>While still a small group, our little community is growing strong.
					We meet on the first Saturday of the month to collaborate and network with other women in the field with diverse skillsets.
					</p>

				<div class="support">
					<h3>How to Support</h3>
					<p>If you know someone who would be interested in joining SoCo WIT, spread the word!
					We are always looking to diversify our group with strong women.
